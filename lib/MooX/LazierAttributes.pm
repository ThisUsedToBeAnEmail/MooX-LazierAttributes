=head1 EXPORT

=head2 attributes

I'm a list, my content gets transformed into Moo Attributes. My keys can either be a scalar or an array reference of scalars,
they are used as the (*has*) name when constructing the Attributes.

    one => [],
    [qw/two three/] => []
    ...
    has one => ( is => 'ro' );
    has [qw/two three/] => ( is => 'ro' );

My value has to be an array reference, which can contain 3 indexes. If I was to write a read-write attribute that
had a type constraint was lazy and also had a builder. It would look something like this.

    attributes (
        example => [ rw, ArrayRef, { lzy, bld } ],
    );

    ....

    has example => (
        is => 'rw',
        isa => ArrayRef,
        lazy => 1,
        builder => 1,
    );

The values first index - *is* - can only ever be ro/rw. A lot of the time you only actually want read-only so we can default that.
I'll show you Another example this time we have a read-only attribute, that has a type constraint and is required.

    attributes (
        example => [ Str, { req } ]
    )

    ....

    has example => (
        is => 'ro',
        isa => Str,
        required => 1,
    );

As you can see we have dropped the first index (*is*). The last index the [1] above and [2] in my first
example must always be a hash reference that conforms to Moo attribute Standards. This module exports
constants that try to make filling this reference less repetitive. Sometimes you may not always need extra,
Moo Magic - a read-only attribute with just a type constraint.

    attributes (
        example => [ArrayRef],
    );

    ....

    has example => (
        is => 'ro',
        isa => ArrayRef
    );

And just a read-only attribute...

    attributes (
        example => [],
    );

=head2 Constants

When you *use* L<MooX::LazierAttributes> by default It will export the following constants.

You can restrict which constants get imported the same way you would with any other Exporter.

    use MooX::LazierAttributes qw/ro rw lzy bld/;

=head3 ro

'ro'

=head3 is_ro

( is => 'ro' )

=head3 rw

'rw'

=head3 is_rw

( is => 'rw' )

=head3 nan

undef

=head3 lzy;

( lazy => 1 )

=head3 bld

( builder => 1 )

=head3 lzy_bld

( lazy_build => 1 ),

=head3 trg

( tigger => 1 ),

=head3 req

( required => 1 ),

=head3 coe

( coerce => 1 ),

=head3 lzy_hash

( lazy => 1, default => sub { {} } )

=head3 lzy_array

( lazy => 1, default => sub { [] } )

=head3 lzy_str

( lazy => 1, default => sub { '' } )

=head3 dhash

( default => sub { {} } )

=head3 darray

( default => sub { [] } )

=head3 dstr

( default => sub { '' } )
