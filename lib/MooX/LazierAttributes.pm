=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Hello::World;
    
    use Moo;
    use MooX::LazierAttributes;

    attributes (
        one   => [], # defaults to be ro
        two   => [{}],
        three => [sub { My::Thing->new() }, { lzy, }],
        [qw/four five six/] => [rw, 'ruling the world'],
    );

    has seven => ( is_ro, lzy, default => sub { [qw/a b c/] });

    .....

    my $hello = Hello::World->new({ 
        one => 1,
        two => { three => 'four' },   
    });

    $hello->one;    # 1
    $hello->two;    # { three => 'four' }
    $hello->three;  # $obj

    ... Extending .....

    package Extends::Hello::World;

    use Moo;
    use MooX::LazierAttributes;

    extends 'Hello::World';
    
    attributes (
        '+one' => ['hey'],
        '+two' => [[qw/why are you inside/]],
        [qw/+four +five +six/] => ['well the sun it hurts my eyes'],
    );

    my $hello = Extends::Hello::World->new();

    $hello->one;    # hey
    $hello->two;    # ['why', 'are', 'you', 'inside'],
    $hello->four;   # well the sun it hurts my eyes

    ... What if I like Types ...

    package Hello::World;
    
    use Moo;
    use MooX::LazierAttributes qw/is_ro rw lzy bld/;
    use Types::Standard qw/Str HashRef ArrayRef Object/;

    attributes (
        one   => [Str], # defaults to be ro
        two   => [HashRef],
        three => [Object, { lzy, bld }],
        [qw/four five six/] => [rw, Str, { default => 'ruling the world' }],
    );

    has seven => ( is_ro, lzy, isa => ArrayRef, default => sub { [qw/a b c/] });

    sub _build_three { 
        return My::Thing->new();
    }

=head1 EXPORT

=head2 attributes

I'm a list, my content gets transformed into Moo Attributes. My keys can either be a scalar or an array reference of scalars, 
they are used as the (*has*) name when constructing the Attributes.
    
    one => [],
    [qw/two three/] => []
    ...
    has one => ( is => 'ro' );
    has [qw/two three/] => ( is => 'ro' );

My value has to be an array reference, which can contain 3 indexes. If I was to write a read-write attribute that 
had a type constraint was lazy and also had a builder. It would look something like this.

    attributes (
        example => [ rw, ArrayRef, { lzy, bld } ],
    );
    
    ....
    
    has example => (
        is => 'rw',
        isa => ArrayRef,
        lazy => 1,
        builder => 1,
    );

The values first index - *is* - can only ever be ro/rw. A lot of the time you only actually want read-only so we can default that.
I'll show you Another example this time we have a read-only attribute, that has a type constraint and is required.

    attributes (
        example => [ Str, { req } ]
    )
    
    ....
    
    has example => (
        is => 'ro',
        isa => Str,  
        required => 1,
    );

As you can see we have dropped the first index (*is*). The last index the [1] above and [2] in my first 
example must always be a hash reference that conforms to Moo attribute Standards. This module exports 
constants that try to make filling this reference less repetitive. Sometimes you may not always need extra,
Moo Magic - a read-only attribute with just a type constraint.

    attributes (
        example => [ArrayRef],
    );

    ....
    
    has example => (
        is => 'ro',
        isa => ArrayRef
    );

And just a read-only attribute...
    
    attributes (
        example => [],
    );

=head2 Constants

When you *use* L<MooX::LazierAttributes> by default It will export the following constants.

You can restrict which constants get imported the same way you would with any other Exporter.

    use MooX::LazierAttributes qw/ro rw lzy bld/;

=head3 ro

'ro'

=head3 is_ro

( is => 'ro' )

=head3 rw

'rw'

=head3 is_rw

( is => 'rw' )

=head3 nan

undef

=head3 lzy;

( lazy => 1 )

=head3 bld

( builder => 1 )

=head3 lzy_bld 

( lazy_build => 1 ),

=head3 trg

( tigger => 1 ),

=head3 req

( required => 1 ),

=head3 lzy_hash

( lazy => 1, default => sub { {} } )

=head3 lzy_array

( lazy => 1, default => sub { [] } )
